0. Point out it was last updated 2021-07-29.

0. In the source, point out the data dictionary and user guide, scroll down to see the column descriptons.

    * google dog evolution tree data
    * find research gate
    * see realted images
    * see the word 'phylogenetic', thats a new google term you can use. 
    * open paper, use command+f search for 'data' or 'download' 


#### [How I got the data for this lecture]
0. Google, ["pandas data cleaning tutorial"]((https://www.google.com/search?q=pandas+data+cleaning+tutorial&oq=pandas+data+cleaning+tutorial+&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyCAgAEEUYHhg5Mg0IARAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IAhAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IAxAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMgoIBBAAGIAEGKIEMgoIBRAAGIAEGKIEMgoIBhAAGIAEGKIE0gEINTAzNWowajGoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8))
0. Open a few links. But end up on the [w3 schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_cleaning.asp).
